# StableFlow Protocol
*Stablecoin Liquidity Amplification Network on Stacks*

## Overview

StableFlow is a sophisticated liquidity amplification protocol that dynamically manages stablecoin supply and demand across the Stacks ecosystem. By leveraging Bitcoin's security through Stacks' unique architecture, StableFlow aims to create a more efficient and stable DeFi infrastructure.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Supply Management**: Automated stablecoin minting/burning based on real-time demand
- **Intelligent AMM**: Advanced automated market making with liquidity amplification
- **Bitcoin-Backed Stability**: Leverages Bitcoin's security for enhanced stablecoin stability
- **Cross-Protocol Integration**: Optimizes liquidity across multiple stablecoin protocols
- **400% Efficiency Target**: Designed to amplify liquidity efficiency by 4x through intelligent routing

## Current Status: Phase 1 Development 🚧

### ✅ Completed Contracts

#### `math-utils.clar`
Core mathematical operations for the protocol:
- Safe arithmetic operations (overflow/underflow protection)
- AMM calculations (constant product formula)
- Liquidity token calculations
- Price impact assessment
- Slippage validation

#### `security-utils.clar`
Security and access control framework:
- Emergency pause/resume functionality
- Authorized operator management
- Input validation and parameter checking
- Access control for admin operations
- Contract initialization and status management

### 🔄 In Progress
- Core pool contract (`stableflow-pool.clar`)
- Basic AMM implementation (`stableflow-amm.clar`)
- Testing framework setup

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation - *Current Phase*
- ✅ Math utilities contract
- ✅ Security utilities contract
- 🔄 Core liquidity pool functionality
- 🔄 Basic AMM implementation
- 🔄 Testing framework
- 🔄 Simple frontend interface

### Phase 2: Dynamic Management
- Oracle integration for demand monitoring
- Dynamic supply adjustment algorithms
- Enhanced AMM with slippage protection
- Pool analytics dashboard

### Phase 3: Multi-Stablecoin Integration
- USDC integration contract
- USDT integration contract
- Cross-pool arbitrage mechanisms
- Advanced liquidity routing

### Key Innovation: Demand-Responsive Liquidity

Unlike traditional AMMs that maintain static liquidity pools, StableFlow dynamically adjusts stablecoin supply based on:
- Real-time demand monitoring
- Cross-protocol arbitrage opportunities
- Bitcoin network security integration
- Predictive supply management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) - Stacks smart contract development tool
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)
- Git

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/adenikeakan/stableflow-protocol
cd stableflow-protocol

# Install Clarinet (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.clarinet.dev | sh

# Initialize project
clarinet new stableflow-protocol
cd stableflow-protocol

# Run tests
clarinet test

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check
```

### Testing Current Contracts
```bash
# Test math utilities
clarinet console
# In console:
(contract-call? .math-utils safe-multiply u100 u200)
(contract-call? .math-utils calculate-sqrt u25)

# Test security utilities
(contract-call? .security-utils initialize)
(contract-call? .security-utils is-initialized)
```

## Why Stacks?

StableFlow is built on Stacks to leverage unique capabilities:
